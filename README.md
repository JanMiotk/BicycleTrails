# BicycleTrails

It is necessary to instal HtmlAgilityPack

It is my school project which I modified for myself. I tried use here the best solid practice. Everything is in separate modules, interfaces are created to operate class behaviours using dependency injection like ninject. I adapted IDataDownloader as an extensible interface which can implement more specific feature in the future. Project has three main parts. First is datatcollector which collect data from traseo.pl. I separate it in three classes and each class collect different data because of long waiting to end. All downloaded data are serialize into files.  Second is application here I used two databases one store trails data another users data. Both have different DBSM provider. I added policy with claims that supports authorization policy. Admin has specific permission to manipulate data in database. Trails show after user login. User may chose specific trail and server will display informations. I used openlayers to draw routes and OSRM server to get json geometry which I can display. Last part contains unit test.
